# PolynomialCurveFittingModel

This is a mini-project and my first attempts at implementing a machine learning algorithm. Taking inspiration from the textbook
"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Biship in which the first chapter mentions mathematical notation to curve fitting
for "observation" points.

While learning for personal educational gains, I took it upon myself to attempt at an implementation of the mathematical demonstrations given
and in return I have a semi-viable model for analyzing and predicting a "curve of best fit" from N number of observations.

There are multiple ways I could make this project even further sufficient to predicting lines, such as finding proper initial conditions and 
also saving more that just the best from each generation but for a simple project I will not dive further than this base level implementation
of the algorithm for polynomial curve fitting.
